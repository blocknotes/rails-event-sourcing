Description:
    Create an event model (and a base event model, if missing).

    The first argument must be in the form: namespace/event_name
    The extra arguments are data attributes handled by the event

Example:
    bin/rails generate events:event users/created name age

    This will create:
        app/events/users/event.rb
        app/events/users/created_event.rb

    In the event model a basic apply method is defined with the specified attributes.
